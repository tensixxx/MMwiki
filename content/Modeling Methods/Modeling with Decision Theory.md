### Probability and Expected Value
$$
\text{probability of an event = } \frac {\text{favorable outcomes}} {\text{total outcomes}}
$$
#### Weighted Average
The formula of **expected value** is:
$$
E = w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2 + \cdots + w_n p_n
$$
or
$$
E = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i p_i
$$
where $w_i$ is the **payoff** of each **outcome**, $p_i (0 \leq p_i \leq 1)$ is the corresponding **probability**. Note that weightes must sum to 1.

#### Sensitivity Analysis
A typical decision model depends on many assumptions. We use sensitivity analysis to determine how the probabilities are likely to change.

### Decision Trees

A **terminal node** with a **consequence branch**showing the payoff for that outcome. 

#### Sequential Decisions and Conditional Probabilities
**Sequential Decision**: Decision is made step by step, where each decision depends on the previous outcome. 
**Conditional Probability**: The probability of one event when another event has already occurred.
